## Laravel Long Polling Chat Example
For this project, I will show you how to use "Long Polling" method in Laravel.   
And it'll be a normal chat system, not very complex.   
With this example, I think you'll be able to build your own chat system more amazing features & more complex :D    

## Functionals
- Join a global chat room with specific name
- Chat (text, image)
- Real-time retrieve message by using Long Polling method.

## Technologies/Libraries used
- PHP 7+
- Laravel 5.6 (latest)
- Laravel Mix
- Javascript
- VueJS 2.x
- Axios

## How to install?
- Clone this project
- Run: `composer install`
- Config your DB in .env file
- Run: `php artisan migrate`
- Now you can go to the project's public path too test :D

Note: you don't need to build vueJS files again. I'll build the latest one for you after any commit.
